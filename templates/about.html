            <h2>This website was designed for people who are just starting to play poker and would like to practice their
            skills in playing without the risk of losing money or being intimidated or harassed by other players in live
            online games.

            <h2>New players need to learn and familiarize themselves with the different poker hands as well as
                knowing when to proceed to the next street (flop, turn, river) or when to fold their hands to minimize
                loss, while having fun.

            <h2>The game is between a player (you) and the dealer (your computer).  In a new game, the player is given
                $5,000 initial stack. Once the stack is down to $400, it is automatically replenished back to $5,000.
            </h2>

            <h2>Pre-flop bet is $20 which is automatically taken from the player's stack.  On the
                flop, the player decides to proceed to the turn with a $30 bet, or fold, losing only the initial $20 bet.

                On the turn, the player has to bet $50 to continue to the river, or fold, losing $50 (bet on preflop $20
                and flop $30). On the river, the bet is $100 to proceed to the showdown, or fold, losing $100.
                At showdown, the player either wins or lose the total pot of $400.
